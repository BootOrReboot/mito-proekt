                One of the staples of traditional Turkish cuisine, sarma
                consists of a filling that is snugly surrounded by leaves or
                leafy vegetables.<br />
                There are numerous versions of this dish but the mixture
                typically combines ingredients such as minced meat, rice or
                bulgur, various herbs, seasonings, red pepper, paprika, ground
                sumac, or tomato sauce, while the typical wrapping usually
                includes vine, cabbage, or sauerkraut leaves, or a variety of
                leafy vegetables such as collard greens and swiss chard.

                Tav훾e grav훾e is the national dish of North Macedonia consisting
                of beans stewed with onions, oil, dried pepper flakes, and
                seasonings such as salt, parsley, and black pepper.<br />
                Although it is primarily a vegetarian dish, some recipes call
                for the addition of smoked pork, bacon, sausages, or suho
                meso.<br />
                The dish is baked in an earthenware bowl and usually served in
                it, keeping the beans warm.<br />
                Tav훾e grav훾e is traditionally enjoyed on Fridays or during
                fasting (the original vegetarian recipe), but in restaurants, it
                is often served as a side dish to grilled meats.
